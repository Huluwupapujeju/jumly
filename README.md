# README [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tmtk75/jumly.png)](https://travis-ci.org/tmtk75/jumly)

JUMLY is a JavaScript library.  
Using JUMLY, you can easily embed UML diagram on your HTML document.  
All you need is just two things you use everyday.

- Text editor you get used to use.
- A modern browser like WebKit-base brwoser and Opera.  
  (working for Firefox now)

For more information, see <http://jumly.tmtk.net/>.  
The auther's blog is <http://tmtk75.github.com>.

## Trait and Purpose
Trait I'd like to tell you is that JUMLY doesn't render diagram as image like PNG or SVG,
but render as **combination of DOM with CSS on browser**.
You can easily calibrate any CSS parameters like font-size,
color, padding, margin, etc using CSS at runtime.

Actually you can also usual image data in PNG and JPEG.
They are generated by a [CLI](https://github.com/tmtk75/jumly/wiki/CLI)
or [REST API](https://github.com/tmtk75/jumly/wiki/REST-API),
so JUMLY is convenient way to embed small diagrams in your HTML documents like README file like below.  
<img src='http://jumly.tmtk.net/api/diagrams?data=%40found%20%22You%22%2C%20-%3E%0A%20%20%40message%20%22like%22%2C%20%22JUMLY%22%0A'/>

I aim to develop JUMLY to render small UML diagrams in handy without any heavy UML modeling tools.
A UML diagram is usually more understandable than a tedious text.
It's better that people can casually use UML digrams in every documents.


# Getting Started
Copy following code, save as a file, and open the file with your browser.

```html
<head>
<script src='http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.0.min.js'></script>
<script src='http://coffeescript.org/extras/coffee-script.js'></script>
<script src='http://jumly.tmtk.net/public/jumly.min.js'></script>
</head>
<body>
<script type='text/jumly+sequence'>
@found "You", ->
  @message "meet", "JUMLY"
</script>
</body>
```

[Here](http://jumly.tmtk.net/public/examples/simple.html) is a minimal sample.


# How to build
Requiring [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) v0.10.20 or upper.

## node.js installation
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) is good to get it.

    $ git clone git://github.com/creationix/nvm.git ~/.nvm
    $ . ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
    $ nvm install 0.10

## Build jumly

In order to build jumly.js, jumly.css and minified ones, it's shortly steps.

    $ git clone https://github.com/tmtk75/jumly.git
    $ cd jumly
    $ . .env
    $ npm install
    $ make build

`./public/jumly.min.js` is generated.


# How to develop
Written in CoffeeScript and stylus. They are in `./lib` directory.
`./lib/js/jumly.coffee` organizes other \*.coffee files in order.

On a webapp, which is described at [next](#how-to-launch-the-webapp),
you can use them without build.
Editing \*.coffee and \*.styl, reload a page of webapp, and your change will make effect.


# How to launch the webapp
You can launch the webapp using [express](http://expressjs.com/).

    $ . .env
    $ git submodule update --init
    $ ./app.coffee

Please access to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) thru your browser.


# How to run specs
## With browser

    $ make test

Compile spec files, and open `./spec/index.html` with your browser.

## With Karma
To compile them,

    $ . .env
    $ build karam
    $ open spec/index.html

[jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) is used for writing specs.
