          dd Wanted to copy a string, like a class name and something phrase, from UML note icon.

            | There was something you don't like at diagram which application generated.

          dt Everything is text
          dd
            | Input data is text, and output format is text/html. It's great advantage to proprietary binnary data format,
            | because we can use SCM like Subversion/Mercurial/Git to manage and version the data.
          dt Easy to use
          dd You need only a web browser and a text editor you get used to.
          dt Fast for everything
          dd The time you get a diagram since you want it. The time JUMLY render diagram. The time you know JUMLY.

            dt High quality
            dd You can get keen designed diagrams, especially on MacOSX
            dt Concentrative
            dd You can concentrate on your modeling regardless of the layout for UML icons.
            dt Based on DOM and jQuery
            dd Diagrams JUMLY renders are composed with DOM/jQuery node, so you've already understand the way to handle them.
            dt Powered by HTML5/CSS3
            dd
              | In addition the above, you will get HTML5/CSS3 bless.
              | For example, you can edit the styles of icons applying CSS.
            dt Light and small
            dd
              | Now the size of script is 56KB, and the size of stylesheet is 16KB.
              | They are relatively lighter than the UML modeling tools =)
