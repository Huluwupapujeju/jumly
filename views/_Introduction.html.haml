    %h2 What's JUMLY?
    %p JUMLY is a JavaScript library.
    %p Using JUMLY, you can easily embed UML diagram on your HTML document.  
    %p All you need are just two in order to use JUMLY.
    %ul
      %li Text editor you get used to use.
      %li Modern browser like WebKit-base brwoser and Opera. |
          (now planning it works on other browsers, especially Firefox.) |

    %p To render in your HTML document, put below tags in your &lt;head> section.
    %pre{class: 'brush: html'}
      :preserve
        &lt;link href='jumly.min.css' rel="stylesheet"/>
        &lt;script src='jquery.min.js'>&lt;/script>
        &lt;script src='coffee-script.js'>&lt;/script>
        &lt;script src='jumly.min.js'>&lt;/script>
    %p Put the next &lt;script> tag at the place you want to render. |
      The diagram will be inserted after ths script element. |

        &lt;/script>
    %p
      You'll get a diagram like the right.
      You are ready to use JUMLY =)

  %h2.span12 Did you have these experiences?
  .span12
    %ul
      %li Getting many small diagrams which have a few icons and relationships. |
        Then you launched an UML modeling tool, and create a new project, and make a model, ... |
      %li Wanted to copy a string, like a class name and something phrase, from UML note icon.
      %li There was something you don't like at diagram which application generated. |
        For instance, color, size, line width, font, and so on. |
      %li Couldn't understand difference b/w old diagram and updated one.
      %li Couldn't open an application file on other computer you don't usually use.

-# Why you use JUMLY ==========================================================
%section#why-you-use-jumly.row
  %h2.span12 Why you use JUMLY
  .span12
    %dl
      %dt Fast for everything
      %dd The time you get a diagram since you want it. The time JUMLY render diagram. The time you know JUMLY.
      %dt Easy to use
      %dd You need only a web browser and a text editor you get used to.
      %dt High quality
      %dd You can get keen designed diagrams, especially on MacOSX
      %dt Concentrative
      %dd You can concentrate on your modeling regardless of the layout for UML icons.
      %dt Everything is text
      %dd
        Input data is text, and output format is text/html. It's great advantage to proprietary binnary data format,
        because we can use SCM like Subversion/Mercurial/Git to manage and version the data.
      %dt Based on DOM and jQuery
      %dd Diagrams JUMLY renders are composed with DOM/jQuery node, so you've already understand the way to handle them.
      %dt Powered by HTML5/CSS3
      %dd
        In addition the above, you will get HTML5/CSS3 bless.
        For example, you can edit the styles of icons applying CSS.
      %dt Light and small
      %dd
        Now the size of script is 56KB, and the size of stylesheet is 16KB.
        They are relatively lighter than the UML modeling tools :)
