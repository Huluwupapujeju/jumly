    %h2 What's JUMLY?
    %p JUMLY is a JavaScript library to compose UML diagram dynamically with styled node.
  
  .span5.columns
    %p
      There are two UML diagrams at the right, which are an usecase diagram and a sequence-diagram,
      and also there are a few lines under the diagrams.
    %p
      Open the HTML source, and check them out right now if you're software engineer.
      Those are <strong>NOT</strong> image.
      You will be surprised that you can draw easier than your expectation.
    %p
      You can take some diagrams using a simple DSL into your document.
      JUMLY provides one of the best ways to compose UML diagram.
    %p.emphasis
      Making high quality UML diagrams with a few typings.<br/>
      It's JUMLY.

        &lt;link type='text/css' rel='stylesheet' href='jumly-min.css'/>

    %p Put the next &lt;script> tag at the place you want to draw. |
      The diagram will be inserted after ths script element. |

  .span16.columns
    %ul
      %li Getting many small diagrams which have a few icons and relationships. |
        Then you launched an UML modeling tool, and create a new project, and make a model, ... |
      %li Wanted to copy a string, like a class name and something phrase, from UML note icon.
      %li There was something you don't like at diagram which application generated. |
        For instance, color, size, line width, font, and so on. |
      %li Couldn't understand difference b/w old diagram and updated one.
      %li Couldn't open an application file on other computer you don't usually use.

<!-- Why you use JUMLY ======================================================== -->
#why-you-use-jumly.row
  %h2.span16.columns Why you use JUMLY
  .span16.columns
    %dl
      %dt Fast for everything
      %dd The time you get a diagram since you want it. The time JUMLY render diagram. The time you know JUMLY.
      %dt Easy to use
      %dd You need only a web browser and a text editor you get used to.
      %dt High quality
      %dd You can get keen designed diagrams, especially on MacOSX
      %dt Concentrative
      %dd You can concentrate on your modeling regardless of the layout for UML icons.
      %dt Everything is text
      %dd
        Input data is text, and output format is text/html. It's great advantage to proprietary binnary data format,
        because we can use SCM like Subversion/Mercurial/Git to manage and version the data.
      %dt Based on DOM and jQuery
      %dd Diagrams JUMLY renders are composed with DOM/jQuery node, so you've already understand the way to handle them.
      %dt Powered by HTML5/CSS3
      %dd
        In addition the above, you will get HTML5/CSS3 bless.
        For example, you can edit the styles of icons applying CSS.
      %dt Light and small
      %dd
        Now the size of script is 56KB, and the size of stylesheet is 16KB.
        They are relatively lighter than the UML modeling tools :)
