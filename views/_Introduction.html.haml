    %ul
      %li Getting many small diagrams which have a few icons and relationships. |
        Then you launched an UML modeling tool, and create a new project, and make a model, ... |
      %li Wanted to copy a string, like a class name and something phrase, from UML note icon.
      %li There was something you don't like at diagram which application generated. |
        For instance, color, size, line width, font, and so on. |
      %li Couldn't understand difference b/w old diagram and updated one.
      %li Couldn't open an application file on other computer you don't usually use.

    %dl
      %dt Fast for everything
      %dd The time you get a diagram since you want it. The time JUMLY render diagram. The time you know JUMLY.
      %dt Easy to use
      %dd You need only a web browser and a text editor you get used to.
      %dt High quality
      %dd You can get keen designed diagrams, especially on MacOSX
      %dt Concentrative
      %dd You can concentrate on your modeling regardless of the layout for UML icons.
      %dt Everything is text
      %dd
        Input data is text, and output format is text/html. It's great advantage to proprietary binnary data format,
        because we can use SCM like Subversion/Mercurial/Git to manage and version the data.
      %dt Based on DOM and jQuery
      %dd Diagrams JUMLY renders are composed with DOM/jQuery node, so you've already understand the way to handle them.
      %dt Powered by HTML5/CSS3
      %dd
        In addition the above, you will get HTML5/CSS3 bless.
        For example, you can edit the styles of icons applying CSS.
      %dt Light and small
      %dd
        Now the size of script is 56KB, and the size of stylesheet is 16KB.
        They are relatively lighter than the UML modeling tools :)
